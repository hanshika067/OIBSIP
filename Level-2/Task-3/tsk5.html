      <h2>About Ratan Tata</h2>
      <p>
        Ratan Naval Tata, born on December 28, 1937, is one of India's most celebrated business magnates and philanthropists. As the former chairman of Tata Group, he transformed a traditional industrial conglomerate into a global force.
      </p>
      <p>
        His legacy isn’t measured just in numbers, but in values—integrity, simplicity, compassion. Ratan Tata believes in doing business with a conscience, and his work continues to touch millions of lives across India.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
      <p>
        What I admire most is his humility. Even with global recognition, he remains grounded and people-focused. His bold decisions—like the Tata Nano and acquiring Jaguar Land Rover—came from a place of social good and national pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t believe in taking right decisions. I take decisions and make them right.” — This quote reflects his wisdom, courage, and belief in personal responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Ratan Tata has left an indelible mark on India’s industrial history. But beyond business, he will always be remembered as a compassionate visionary whose success was matched only by his generosity.
